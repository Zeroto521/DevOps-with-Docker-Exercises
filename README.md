This project is the exercises of the [DevOps with Docker 2022](https://devopswithdocker.com/).

## What is `DevOps with Docker 2022`

> This course is an introductory course to Docker and docker-compose. The course will also look into what different parts web services consist of, such as reverse proxies, databases, etc. Docker can not be installed on faculty computers, so students will need to use their computers to follow the examples outlined in this course material and to complete the exercises.
